nme-tilelayer
=============

A lightweight and very optimized wrapper over NME's powerful but lowlevel 'drawTiles' which offers the best rendering performance 
(ie. batching) on native platforms.

**See [NME RunnerMark][1] for a sample project using this library.**

 - provides a basic display-list, spritesheet animations, mirroring (tile flipping), scale X/Y,
 - includes a Sparrow spritesheet parser, supporting trimming,
 - uses (and caches computations of) the new drawTiles' transform2x2 for native platforms,
 - uses Bitmaps for Flash & HTML5 target rendering,
 - very optimized memory management, near-zero garbage collection.

**Warning:** TileLayer is a "batching" class so it should be used to display "many elements" - that means you should 
include as many sprites/anims as possible in the spritesheet. Creating many TileLayers is conter-productive, because 
having many textures and not doing batching is inefficient for GPU performance.

Usage
-----
- install the library: type `haxelib install tilelayer` in your terminal
- add `<haxelib name="tilelayer" />` in your nmml

Configure it:

```as3
// sprite sheet
var tilesheet = new SparrowTilesheet(
    Assets.getBitmapData("assets/spritesheet.png"), Assets.getText("assets/spritesheet.xml"));

// tile-layer
var layer = new TileLayer(tilesheet); // optional flags: smoothing, additive blendmode
```

Add/manipulate elements as a display list:

```as3
// static tile
var sprite = new TileSprite("spritename");
layer.addChild(sprite);

// animated tile
var clip = new TileClip("animname");
clip.loop = false;
layer.addChild(clip);

// tile group (only translation, use the TileGroupTransform behaviour for more)
var group = new TileGroup();
group.addChild(new TileSprite("othername"));
group.addChild(new TileClip("yetanother"));
layer.addChild(group);
```

Render it:

```as3
// batch it!
addChild(layer.view); // layer is NOT a DisplayObject
layer.render();
```

Tiles Features
--------------

**TileLayer properties**
 - view *(root DisplayObject)*
 - useAlpha *(default true)*
 - useTransforms *(default true)*
 - useSmoothing
 - useAdditive
 - useTint

**TileSprite / TileClip properties**
 - tile (set image)
 - x, y
 - rotation
 - scale / scaleX / scaleY
 - alpha
 - mirror *(1: horizontal, 2: vertical)*
 - r / g / b
 - width / height *(readonly)*
 - visible

**TileClip properties**
 - tile (set anim)
 - animated
 - loop
 - currentFrame
 - totalFrames
 - onComplete (TileClip->Void)
 - play / stop

**TileGroup**
 - x, y
 - width / height *(readonly, buggy)*
 - visible
 - addChild / addChildAt / removeChild / removeChildAt

Spritesheets Features
---------------------

**SparrowTilesheet**
 - extends TilesheetEx to parse Sparrow engine tilesheets,
 - supports animation and trimming.

**TilesheetEx**
 - Base class required by TileLayer,
 - animations are matched by name (startsWith) and cached,
 - can be used directly to dynamically build a spritesheet: TilesheetEx.createFromImages, TilesheetEx.createFromAssets

TODO
----
 - fix TileGroup width/height measurement
 - support useTint in Flash/JS fallback

Known issues
------------
 - Tiles' size is null until they are added to the virtual display list,
 - TileGroups inside TileGroup returns incorrect width/height.
